Hello! In order to use this program, you need to create a bot user and find its token. This application creates a local instance of a bot.

To create this bot user, go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and create a new application. Give it a name, a profile picture, make it feel loved and cherished. Then, click on the "Bot" tab, and select the option to create a bot user. There will now be a token section you can copy!

When the token is copied, select all the text in the token.txt file that was in this download, and paste it in!

You can now invite this bot into whatever server you want by going to the OAuth2 tab, clicking the bot scope, and copying the url!
